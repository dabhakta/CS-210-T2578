#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to create a program that would count all groceries that were sold from a file which included a list of all items sold. It would ease the management of inventory by quickly giving a count of how many quantities one or all items were sold.

#What did you do particularly well?
I think the counting of items using Python was done well.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could handle user input better. Do some exception handling to make the code easier to read.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
There wasn't any code in particular that was too difficult, nothing that required outside resources. The Python integration was partly given, so I just had to do a quick syntax refresher for Python.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the major thing is Python integration with C++. Thats a basic thing that will be used many times in the future.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By following proper naming conventions, having proper indentations, formatting, and including comments for all functions, I have made the code readable and maintainable.
